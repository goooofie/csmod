A easy way to install mods for CS 1.6

**⚠️ONLY THE STEAM VERSION IS SUPPORTED BY DEFAULT⚠️**

Required dependencies:
<br/>Cstrike
<br/>AMXMODX
<br/>Steam version of CS 1.6 or recode the source code to your games location

currently also not supporting other drives than the C: drive, but I have a guide on the gitbook to fix it.

project is open source, so you can easily fix it, as I documented it on version v1.1.0 release notes.
